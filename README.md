hello its a simple program and yeah
to use it you need to know some of Poland citys 
enjoy
if it happens that the person that uses it is my University Teacher by using the app (included just seeing how it works)
you agree to give 5 for this project

main2.cpp file contains modified fetchamdsavesesnordata funcion to allow user build their own local database with sensors data


mainWITHDOXYMIGHTBEBROKEN.cpp file contains doxygen comments i wasn't sure if i didn't broke something in the process of creating it that's why i contiunued to work on file without it for example main2.cpp is improved main.cpp without doxy as well as main.cpp might differ a little in some places but it's just fixing bugs (i don't remeber if something was changed at all)

Enjoy!
